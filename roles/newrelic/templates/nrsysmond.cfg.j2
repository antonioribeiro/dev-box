# Setting: hostname
# Type   : string
# Purpose: Sets the name of the host (max 64 characters) that you wish to use
#          for reporting. This is usually determined automatically on startup
#          but you may want to change it if, for example, you have machine
#          generated hostnames that are not visually useful (for example, the
#          names generated by Docker containers).
# Default: The system configured host name
#
hostname="{{ new_relic_hostname | default(ansible_hostname, True) }}"
